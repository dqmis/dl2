Note that the options are negations of the constraints, so the correct answer is the one that is not a negation of a constraint. In this case, option D is the correct answer, as it is not a negation of any constraint.

# Options
Question ::: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
is_exception(is_sat(performance_order(Fernando) - 1 == performance_order(Juanita))) ::: (A)
is_exception(is_sat(performance_order(Ginny) - 1 == performance_order(Hakim))) ::: (B)

is_exception(is_sat(performance_order(Juanita) - 1 == performance_order(Ginny))) ::: (D)
is_exception(is_sat(performance_order(Kevin) - 1 == performance_order(Hakim))) ::: (E)

The correct answer is (D) Juanita performs immediately before Ginny. This is because Juanita must perform after Kevin, and Ginny must perform before Fernando. Therefore, Juanita cannot perform immediately before Ginny.

schedule = Function([programs] -> [times])

# Constraints
ForAll([p:programs], schedule(p) mod 1 == 0 Or schedule(p) mod 1 == 0.5) ::: Generations starts on the hour rather than the half hour, Terry starts on the half hour rather than the hour
ForAll([p:programs], schedule(p) mod 0.5 == 0.5) ::: Roamin' is shown earlier than Sundown
ForAll([p:programs], schedule(Waterloo) < schedule(Terry) => schedule(Waterloo) = schedule(Terry) - 0.5) ::: If Waterloo is shown earlier than Terry, it is shown immediately before Terry
ForAll([p:programs], schedule(Roamin') < schedule(Sundown)) ::: Roamin' is shown earlier than Sundown

# Options
Question ::: If Roamin' is the second program, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:
is_exception(schedule(Sundown) == 1.5) ::: A)
is_exception(schedule(Sundown) == 2.5) ::: B)
is_exception(schedule(Terry) == 2.5) ::: C)
is_exception(schedule(Waterloo) == 1.5) ::: D)
is_exception(schedule(Waterloo) == 2.5) ::: E)

Note that the schedule function is defined as a function from programs to times, where the time is represented as a decimal value between 1 and 3. The constraints ensure that the programs are shown one after the other, each program shown exactly once, and that the schedule meets the given conditions. The options are then evaluated based on the schedule function and the given constraints.

is_valid(schedule(Roamin) == 1.5) ::: C)
is_valid(schedule(Terry) == 3) ::: D)
is_valid(schedule(Waterloo) == 2.5) ::: E)

# Answer:
The correct answer is A) Generations is the first program.

Explanation:
Since Sundown is the third program, the schedule must be: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3]
Given the constraints, Generations starts on the hour, so it must be the first program.

is_exception(is_sat(written(S) == 4)) ::: (E)
Note: The constraints ensure that H cannot be written fourth, as it was written earlier than S but later than F, and it was not written fifth. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer.

assigned = Function([paralegals, cases] -> [bool])

# Constraints

# Options
Question ::: Which one of the following CANNOT be the complete assignment of paralegals to the Sicoli case?
is_invalid(And(assigned(Frank, Sicoli), assigned(Hiro, Sicoli), assigned(Kevin, Sicoli))) ::: (A)
is_invalid(And(assigned(Frank, Sicoli), assigned(Hiro, Sicoli), assigned(Laurie, Sicoli))) ::: (B)

is_invalid(And(assigned(Hiro, Sicoli), assigned(Kevin, Sicoli), assigned(Laurie, Sicoli))) ::: (E)

Note that the option (A) is the correct answer, because if Frank is assigned to Sicoli, then Kevin is also assigned to Sicoli (by the condition "Either Frank is assigned to Raimes and Kevin is assigned to Thompson, or Frank is not assigned to Raimes and Kevin is not assigned to Thompson"), which contradicts the fact that Hiro is assigned to Sicoli.
