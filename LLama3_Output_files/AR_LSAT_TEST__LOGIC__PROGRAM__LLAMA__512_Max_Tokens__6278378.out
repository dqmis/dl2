is_invalid(And(shown(h1, t1), shown(h2, t2), t1 = t2 - 1)) ::: (E)

Note that we can simplify the constraints by using the following:
- `morning` and `afternoon` are consecutive time slots, so `t1 = t2 - 1` implies `t1` is `morning` and `t2` is `afternoon`, or vice versa.
- `evening` is the last time slot, so `t1 = t2 - 1` implies `t1` is `evening` and `t2` is not `evening`, or vice versa.

Also, we can simplify the options by using the following:
- If `h1` and `h2` are shown consecutively, then `t1` and `t2` are consecutive time slots.
- If `h1` is shown in the `evening`, then `h2` cannot be shown consecutively with `h1` because `evening` is the last time slot.

Using these simplifications, we can rewrite the options as:
is_invalid(And(shown(J, morning), shown(K, morning))) ::: (A)
is_invalid(And(shown(J, morning), shown(M, morning))) ::: (B)
is_invalid(And(shown(J, morning), shown(O, morning))) ::: (C)

Note: The `is_determined` function is used to represent the condition that the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined.

Here is the logic program for the problem:

# Declarations
bands = EnumSort([Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, Zircon])
slots = EnumSort([slot_one, slot_two, slot_three, slot_four, slot_five, slot_six])
plays = Function([bands, slots] -> [bool])

# Constraints
Vegemite slot < Zircon slot ::: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon
Wellspring slot < Xpert slot ::: Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert
Uneasy slot >= slot_four ::: Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots
Yardsign slot <= slot_three ::: Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots

# Options
Question ::: Which one of the following CANNOT be the band that performs in slot five?
is_exception(plays(Uneasy, slot_five)) ::: (A)
is_exception(plays(Vegemite, slot_five)) ::: (B)
is_exception(plays(Wellspring, slot_five)) ::: (C)
is_exception(plays(Xpert, slot_five)) ::: (D)
is_exception(plays(Zircon, slot_five)) ::: (E)

Note that the constraints ensure that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, and Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. The question asks which band cannot perform in slot five, and the answer is Vegemite, since it must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.

And(plays(Wellspring, s), plays(Zircon, t), plays(Xpert, u)) -> s < t, t < u ::: Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert
ForAll([b:bands], Count([s:slots], plays(b, s)) == 1) ::: Each band will perform in just one slot
ForAll([s:slots], Or(plays(Uneasy, s), plays(Vegemite, s), plays(Yardsign, s))) ::: Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots
ForAll([s:slots], Or(plays(Yardsign, s), plays(Vegemite, s), plays(Uneasy, s))) ::: Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots

# Options
Question ::: If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, which one of the following is the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform?
is_valid(plays(Wellspring, slot_two)) ::: (A)
is_valid(plays(Wellspring, slot_three)) ::: (B)

slots = EnumSort([slot_one, slot_two, slot_three, slot_four, slot_five, slot_six])
in_slot = Function([bands, slots] -> [bool])

# Constraints
Vegemite PerformsBefore Zircon ::: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon
Wellspring PerformsBefore Xpert, Zircon PerformsBefore Xpert ::: Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert
Uneasy InLastThree, Yardsign InFirstThree ::: Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots and Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots
Vegemite InSlotThree ::: Vegemite performs in slot three

# Options
Question ::: If Vegemite performs in slot three, which one of the following must be true?
is_valid(And(Xpert InSlotFour, Uneasy InSlotFive, Uneasy PerformsBefore Xpert)) ::: A)
is_valid(And(Wellspring InSlotOne, Zircon InSlotTwo, Wellspring PerformsBefore Zircon)) ::: B)
is_valid(And(Xpert InSlotOne, Uneasy InSlotSix, Xpert PerformsBefore Uneasy)) ::: C)
is_valid(And(Yardsign InSlotOne, Wellspring InSlotTwo, Yardsign PerformsBefore Wellspring)) ::: D)
is_valid(And(Zircon InSlotFive, Uneasy InSlotSix, Zircon PerformsBefore Uneasy)) ::: E)

Note: We use the "PerformsBefore" predicate to represent the constraint that one band performs before another. We also use the "InLastThree" and "InFirstThree" predicates to represent the constraints that Uneasy and Yardsign perform in the last three and first three slots, respectively.
