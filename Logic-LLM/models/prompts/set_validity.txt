Task Description: You are given a problem description and image and a question. The task is to:
1) Understand the given question by reading it carefully and looking at the accompanying image.
2) Parse the problem into Answer Set Programming (ASP) language compatible with a Clingo solver. The program must be included within ###ASP_START### and ###ASP_END### block.
3) Objects and rules defined in the example should be sufficient for solving the problem. You should modify or add facts that define state provided in the image.
4) For solving the problem only use the second image given.

Here is an example below that is based on the first image:

Problem:
You have a picture of SET card game deck. In the game, certain combinations of three cards are said to make up a "set". A set consists of three cards satisfying all of these conditions: they all have the same number or have three different numbers, shapes, shadings or colors. Can you tell if such set exists?

Options:
A) Yes
B) No
