We don't have any direct facts about this.  However, we can use the rules to infer information.\n\n1. **Rule 1:**  We need to find something that is kind and eats the tiger.  We know the tiger is big, but we don't have any information about what eats the tiger.  This rule doesn't help us.\n\n2. **Rule 2:**  We don't have any information about what chases the cat, so this rule doesn't help us.\n\n3. **Rule 3:**  We know the dog chases the tiger, so this rule tells us that the tiger needs the rabbit.  This doesn't help us with the dog needing itself.\n\n4. **Rule 4:**  We don't have any information about the rabbit chasing the tiger, so this rule doesn't help us.\n\n5. **Rule 5:**  We don't have any information about what chases the cat, so this rule doesn't help us.\n\n6. **Rule 6:**  We know the rabbit eats the dog, so this rule tells us that the rabbit chases the cat.  This doesn't help us with the dog needing itself.\n\n7. **Rule 7:**  We know the dog is kind, and we know that kind things are rough.  This tells us the dog is rough.  We also know that rough things eat the dog.  This doesn't help us with the dog needing itself.\n\n8. **Rule 8:**  We know the dog is kind, but we don't have any information about what eats the rabbit, so this rule doesn't help us.\n\n9. **Rule 9:**  We know the rabbit eats the rabbit, and the rabbit is big, so this rule tells us that the rabbit is kind.

However, we can use the rules to infer this information.\n\nRule 4 states that if someone eats the cat and chases the rabbit, then the rabbit likes the mouse. We know that the dog is blue (fact 3) and that blue people eat the cat (rule 8). Therefore, the dog eats the cat. We also know that the cat chases the rabbit (fact 1). This satisfies the conditions of rule 4, so we can conclude that the rabbit likes the mouse.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nBased on the given information, the statement \"The rabbit likes the mouse\" is **true**. \n"

We need to determine if Anne is cold based on the given information.\n\nThe facts tell us that Anne is furry and rough. There are no direct facts about Anne being cold. However, we can use the rules to infer information about Anne.\n\n* **Rule 1:**  Red things are not kind. This rule is not relevant to Anne's coldness.\n* **Rule 2:** If something is cold and not furry then it is not kind. This rule is not applicable to Anne because she is furry.\n* **Rule 3:** Green, rough things are quiet. This rule is not directly relevant to Anne's coldness, but it might be useful later.\n* **Rule 4:** If something is furry and cold then it is quiet. This rule is relevant to Anne. Since Anne is furry, if she were cold, she would also be quiet.\n* **Rule 5:** If Bob is furry then Bob is green. This rule is not relevant to Anne.\n* **Rule 6:** Rough things are green. This rule is not directly relevant to Anne's coldness, but it might be useful later.\n* **Rule 7:** If something is kind and not furry then it is green. This rule is not relevant to Anne's coldness.\n* **Rule 8:** All quiet things are cold. This rule is relevant to Anne. If Anne were quiet, then she would be cold.\n* **Rule 9:** Cold things are red. This rule is relevant to Anne. If Anne were cold, then she would be red.\n\n**Combining the rules:**\n\n* We know Anne is furry.\n* If Anne were cold, she would be quiet (Rule 4).\n* If Anne were quiet, she would be cold (Rule 8).\n* If Anne were cold, she would be red (Rule 9).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe information provided is contradictory. If Anne were cold, she would be quiet, and if she were quiet, she would be cold. However, there is no information about Anne being quiet. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine if Anne is cold."
