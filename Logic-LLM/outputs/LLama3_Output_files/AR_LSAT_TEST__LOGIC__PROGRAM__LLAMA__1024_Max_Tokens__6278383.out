Note that the options are not exactly the same as the choices in the problem statement. The options are more general and do not specify which two candidates are not assigned to ambassadorships.

is_equivalent(Implies(assigned(Kayne, _), assigned(Jaramillo, _))) ::: A)

Note that the constraint "If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne" is equivalent to "If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo" because the two statements are logically equivalent.

slots = EnumSort([slot_one, slot_two, slot_three, slot_four, slot_five, slot_six])
plays = Function([bands, slots] -> [bool])

# Constraints

And(plays(Wellspring, s), plays(Zircon, t), plays(Xpert, u)) => s < t, t < u ::: Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert

# Options
Question ::: Which one of the following CANNOT be the band that performs in slot five?
is_exception(plays(Uneasy, slot_five)) ::: (A)

is_exception(plays(Wellspring, slot_five)) ::: (C)
is_exception(plays(Xpert, slot_five)) ::: (D)
is_exception(plays(Zircon, slot_five)) ::: (E)

From the constraints, we can deduce that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, and Zircon cannot perform in slot one. This means that Zircon must perform in slot five or later. Therefore, Zircon cannot be the band that performs in slot one. The correct answer is (E) Zircon.

The correct answer is (A) Farley gives the lithographs lecture. This is because the oil paintings and watercolors lectures must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture, and Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley cannot give the lithographs lecture.

Question ::: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
is_sat(And(auctioned(d, table) > auctioned(d, mirror), auctioned(d, table) > auctioned(d, vase), Implies(auctioned(d, harmonica) < auctioned(d, table),?)) ::: (A)
is_sat(And(auctioned(d, table) > auctioned(d, mirror), auctioned(d, table) > auctioned(d, vase), Implies(auctioned(d, lamp) < auctioned(d, table),?)) ::: (B)
is_sat(And(auctioned(d, table) > auctioned(d, mirror), auctioned(d, table) > auctioned(d, vase), Implies(auctioned(d, sundial) < auctioned(d, table),?)) ::: (C)
is_sat(And(auctioned(d, table) > auctioned(d, mirror), auctioned(d, table) > auctioned(d, vase), Implies(auctioned(d, mirror) < auctioned(d, vase),?)) ::: (D)
is_sat(And(auctioned(d, table) > auctioned(d, mirror), auctioned(d, table) > auctioned(d, vase), Implies(auctioned(d, lamp) < auctioned(d, sundial),?)) ::: (E)

Note: The question is asking which option could be true if the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned. The options are all implications, so the correct answer is the one that is most likely to be true given the constraints.

Here is the logic program for the problem:

# Declarations
days = EnumSort([June1st, June2nd, June3rd, June4th, June5th, June6th])
antiques = EnumSort([harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, vase])
auctioned = Function([days, antiques] -> [bool])

# Constraints
Not(auctioned(June1st, sundial)) ::: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st
Implies(auctioned(day, harmonica), auctioned(day, lamp)) -> Implies(auctioned(day, harmonica), auctioned(day, mirror)) ::: If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp
And(auctioned(day, sundial), auctioned(day, mirror)) and And(auctioned(day, sundial), auctioned(day, vase)) ::: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase
Or(auctioned(day, table) and auctioned(e, harmonica), auctioned(day, table) and auctioned(e, vase)) -> Not(And(auctioned(e, harmonica), auctioned(e, vase))) ::: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both
