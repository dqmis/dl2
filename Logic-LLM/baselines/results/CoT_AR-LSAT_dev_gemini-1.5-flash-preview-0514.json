This means Harriet cannot be directly next to Fiona or Karl.\n\n3. **Ingrid and Olivia:** Ingrid sits immediately next to and clockwise from Olivia. This means they are adjacent, with Olivia to Ingrid's left.\n\n4. **Possible Arrangements:**  Let's consider the possible arrangements around the table, starting with Fiona and George:\n\n   * **Scenario 1:** Fiona - X - X - George - X - X - X - X\n   * **Scenario 2:** Fiona - X - X - X - George - X - X - X\n\n5. **Harriet's Placement:** In both scenarios, Harriet cannot be next to Fiona or Karl. This means Harriet must be in one of the remaining spots marked with 'X'.\n\n6. **Ingrid and Olivia's Placement:** Ingrid and Olivia must be together, and Ingrid must be clockwise from Olivia. This means they must be placed in one of the remaining 'X' spots.\n\n7. **Manuel's Placement:**  We need to find the minimum distance between Ingrid and Manuel. To minimize this distance, Manuel should be placed in the spot immediately clockwise from Ingrid.\n\n8. **Minimum Distance:** In this arrangement, there is only **one** person between Ingrid and Manuel (Olivia).\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is B.**"
