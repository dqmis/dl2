The limousine is older than the motorcyle, meaning the motorcyle is newer than the limousine. The truck is newer than the motorcyle, meaning the motorcyle is older than the truck. These cars cannot be the third-newest because we don't have enough information to determine their relative age compared to the others. The tractor is newer than the convertible.
