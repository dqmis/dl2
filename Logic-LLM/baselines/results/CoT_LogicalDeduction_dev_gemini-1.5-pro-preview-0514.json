The red book being to the left of the green book means the green book is further right than the red book.\n\n3. **Combine clues:** We know the red book is to the right of the yellow book. Since the green book is right of the red book, the order so far (from right to left) is:  _ _ Green Red Yellow _ _ _.\n\n4. **Final Placement:**  We know the orange book is leftmost.
