If something sees the rabbit then the rabbit is cold. So the rabbit is cold.\n\nThe correct option is indeed A) True, as the statement \"The rabbit is cold\" is true.\n\nFor the third question:\n\nLet's analyze the information:\n\n* The mouse chases the bear.\n* The mouse chases the rabbit.\n* The mouse visits the rabbit.\n* The rabbit is blue.\n\nFrom the last statement, we can conclude that the mouse needs the rabbit.\n\n* If something visits the mouse and the mouse needs the squirrel then it needs the rabbit. Since the mouse visits the rabbit, it needs the rabbit.\n* If something needs the squirrel then the squirrel visits the mouse. Since the mouse needs the rabbit, it does not need the squirrel.\n\nWe cannot conclude that the bear needs the rabbit. There is no direct relationship between the bear and the rabbit.\n\nThe correct option is indeed C) Unknown, as we cannot determine whether the bear needs the rabbit based on the given information."

The lion sees the tiger.\n\nThe statement says \"The lion does not eat the tiger.\" We need to find a reason that contradicts this statement.\n\nFrom the information, we know that if someone is red and they eat the rabbit, then they are blue. However, the lion is red, so this condition is not applicable to the lion.\n\nWe also know that if someone is nice and they chase the rabbit, then the rabbit is nice. But the lion is nice, so this condition is not applicable to the lion either.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is that the lion eats the tiger. However, if the lion eats the tiger, then the tiger would be nice (from the statement \"If someone eats the tiger then the tiger is nice\"). But we know that the tiger is nice, so this is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"The lion does not eat the tiger\" is false.",

But Fiona is blue, so she is not green.\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that nice, furry things are not green. Since Fiona is nice and furry, she is not green.\n\nFrom statement 5, we know that all furry things are green. But Fiona is not green, so she is not furry.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n* If Fiona is red (option A), then she would be smart (from statement 6) and round (from statement 7). But we know that Fiona is not round, so this option is false.\n* If Fiona is not red (option B), then she could be blue or green. We already established that she is blue, so this option is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB) False"

If Erin is not blue, then she would not be cold (since all cold people are blue). But we know Erin is cold (from (4) and (1)).
