They might still do so, but it's not a direct connection.\n* If Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office, it means they own a large desktop monitor at their home, which means they work regularly and often at home. This, in turn, means they spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n\nSo, if Remy either goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon or visits the office supply store regularly, it's possible that they might still have a fully stocked and impressive home office, which means they spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC) Uncertain"
