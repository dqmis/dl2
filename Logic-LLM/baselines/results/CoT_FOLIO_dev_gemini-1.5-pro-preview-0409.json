    "question": "Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.",
    "answer": "C",
    "predicted_reasoning": "Reasoning:\nPeople either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community. All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances. If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school. All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.  Therefore, people who are not students who attend the school do not wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities. Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school. This means that Bonnie is a student who attends the school and attends and is very engaged with school events. If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events. Therefore, Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.",

If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.",
    "answer": "A",
    "predicted_reasoning": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Understanding the Information:** We are given two possible scenarios for Bonnie. In one, she's potentially a young person interested in academics who chaperones dances. In the other, she doesn't fit that description. We need to see if either scenario forces her to be either a student at the school or an inactive community member.\n\n* **Scenario 1: Young, Academically Driven, Chaperones:**\n    * If she chaperones dances, she's not a student at the school (rule: chaperones aren't students).\n    * If she's not a student, she can't be both \"attends and is engaged\" with school events (rule: those people perform in talent shows).\n    * This DOES make her an inactive and disinterested community member (rule: people are either talent show performers OR inactive members).\n\n* **Scenario 2: Not Young/Academically Driven:**\n    * This doesn't automatically tell us if she's a student or inactive. She could fit other categories not mentioned.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Only one scenario forces Bonnie into one of the target categories (inactive member). The other scenario leaves possibilities open.\n\n**",

This means that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, then the survival rate is not low.

Therefore, it must be true that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents.
